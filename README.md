I wanted a simple way to display the photos I take with my camera.

Instead of linking people to a google drive each image contains an ID which links to that image in the drive.

I wanted to keep this as simple as possible with a static page which also allows me to host it with github pages.

I don't think I like frontend.

I'll update this with more photos as time goes on.
